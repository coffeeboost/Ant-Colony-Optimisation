# Ant-Colony-Optimisation
Research project from Sep 2020 - Feb 2021

# File description
`analyze.ipynb` - jupyter notebook analysis with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib  
`everything.png` - graph of results  
`myBib.bib` - bibliography database for Bibtex and Latex  
`notEverything.png` - graph of results  
`please.py` - main file with algorithm implementation in Python  
`test2.pdf` - paper of my project  
`test2.tex` - Latex file which produced the paper  
`weWinThese.csv` - Data outputted from main file  

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `python please.py` to get data  
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and click Run All  
4. See plots made in Jupyter Notebook  

For Latex:
1. Download TexShop (3 Gb!!)
2. Add bibliographies in myBib.bib with unique keys
3. Update content test2.tex
4. Press on the top left button once with myBib format
5. Press on the top left button twice with LaTex format


# Interesting modifications
1. The graph is up to you to make, so copy any city you want. The assumptions in my code are that there is a starting and ending node called 'a', and that the graph is fully connected.

# Description of algorithm
1. Refer to test2.pdf to understand the motive, process, algorithm and results
