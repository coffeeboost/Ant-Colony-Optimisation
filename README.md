Research project from Sep 2020 - Feb 2021

# File description
`analyze.ipynb` - jupyter notebook analysis with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib  
`everything.png` - graph of results  
`myBib.bib` - bibliography database for Bibtex and Latex  
`notEverything.png` - graph of results  
`please.py` - main file with algorithm implementation in Python  
`test2.pdf` - paper of my project  
`test2.tex` - Latex file which produced the paper  
`weWinThese.csv` - Data outputted from main file  

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `python please.py` to get data  
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and click Run All  
4. See plots made in Jupyter Notebook  

# Interesting modifications
1. The graph is up to you to make, so copy any city you want. The assumptions in my code are that there is a starting and ending node called 'a', and that the graph is fully connected.

# Description of algorithm
1. Refer to test2.pdf to understand the motive, process, algorithm and results
