# Interesting modifications
1. The graph is up to you to make, so copy any city you want. The assumptions in my code are that there is a starting and ending node called 'a', and that the graph is fully connected.

# Description of algorithm
1. Refer to test2.pdf to understand the motive, process, algorithm and results
